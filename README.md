# PB-Tracker
Your Daily Rubik's Cube Personal Best Tracker.
Track your daily progress with ease!

### What is PB?

The PB (Personal Best) is calculated by averaging the time taken for each attempt to solve a Rubik's Cube. This is done by summing up the times of all attempts and then dividing by the total number of attempts. For example, if I solved the cube five times with the following times:

- First attempt: 55 seconds
- Second attempt: 34 seconds
- Third attempt: 48 seconds
- Fourth attempt: 50 seconds
- Fifth attempt: 32 seconds

The PB would be calculated as:
PB = (55 + 34 + 48 + 50 + 32) / 5

Since there are five attempts, the PB is:
PB = 43.8 seconds

## Usage
run the following command in your terminal inside the repo:
```bash
python3 Tracker.py

and have fun with the CLI.
